# 7th-Repo
This assignment is apart of our final project code. We are using an alt-text generator using a api key from gemini. We first start importing the libraries of os, mimetypes, PIL, genai, and types. The api key is then applied. Then we start building our function using generate_alt_text. We have used if,try, and except statements to display the file imported and produce a message if the file is not found. The functions will then run the files to determine what it is viewing. Then it will extract the generated text. The main function is then created by asking the user to enter the path to your image file or quit to exit. We have used if and else statements if the user cannot generate the alt text or it will ask the user if they want to process another image. Then we call the function using the main function.
